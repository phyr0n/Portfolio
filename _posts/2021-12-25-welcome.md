Hi! I've been meaning to start a true portfolio with a domain name that's easily typeable for such a long time. I'm not a web developer or a full stack wizard so choosing a theme and slightly altering it was fairly simple, but I felt restricted with Github Pages and wanted to branch out.

I chose Cloudflare on a whim, hearing about their state-of-the-art DDOS protection - turns out they have a lot of options alongside domain name registration. They have their own built-in continuous integration (CI) system which can deploy websites based on a number of frameworks, as well as viewable preview versions of the website.

I'll write a proper introduction post later, I just want to get a blog post out into the world to test the functionality of Jekyll. :)
